Chapter 1: The Transition from Binary Quorum to Quantum-State Validation
1.1 The Limitation of 676 Bits
In the original Qubic protocol, 676 Computors achieve consensus through a majority vote of binary data (0 or 1). While extremely fast, this logic remains vulnerable to the computational brute-force of future Quantum Adversaries (Q-Day).
1.2 Introducing Q2P (Quorum-to-Peer) Superposition
Quorum-State evolves this by requiring Computors to validate the Probability Amplitude of a transaction. Instead of confirming "Is this transaction 1 or 0?", the Quorum-State network confirms the integrity of the Superposition State before it collapses into a final block.
1.3 No-Cloning Consensus
By utilizing the Quantum No-Cloning Theorem, $QSTATE ensures that a transaction in its "Superposition" phase cannot be copied or double-spent, creating a hardware-level security layer even on classical hardware simulations.
