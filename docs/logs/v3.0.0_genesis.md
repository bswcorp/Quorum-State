- **h2k (Hyper-to-Kernel) Implementation:** Standardized the high-speed bridge between quantum-simulation layers and the core consensus kernel.
- **Q-Link Integration:** Merged legacy Q-link protocols into the new Quorum-State communication stack.
- **Quantum Shield v1.0:** Initial post-quantum cryptography protection.

### Fixed
- **Legacy Log Ambiguity:** Resolved inconsistencies from v2.1.3 regarding h2k and Q-link definitions.
- **Kernel Latency:** Optimized h2k throughput for 676-node synchronization.
# Quorum-State Release Log v3.0.0 (Genesis)
**"The Quantum Leap"**

## - 2026-03-02
### Added
- **Official Brand Identity:** Integration of the new Quorum-State spiral "Q" logo.
- **h2k Architecture (Hyper-to-Kernel):** Standardized high-speed bridge connecting quantum simulation layers to the core 676-node kernel.
- **Q-Link Legacy Patch:** Merged and optimized Q-link communication protocols for quantum-stable data transmission.
- **Quantum Shield v1.0:** Initial Lattice-based cryptography for node-to-node security.

### Fixed
- **Version Fragmentation:** Unified fragmented logs from v2.1.3 and other legacy versions into a single source of truth.
- **h2k Pathfinding:** Resolved previous ambiguity regarding hub-to-kernel communication bottlenecks.

### Changed
