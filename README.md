# Quorum-State ($QSTATE)

**The First Layer-1 Blockchain Integrating Quorum Consensus with Quantum Superposition Logic.**

Quorum-State is a high-performance, post-quantum resistant blockchain. It evolves the principles of Quorum-Based Computation (pioneered by Qubic) by introducing a "Quantum-State Simulation" layer to achieve unconditional security and AI-driven Useful Proof-of-Work (UPoW).

## 🌌 Core Concept: Superposition Consensus
Unlike traditional binary blockchains, Quorum-State nodes (The 676 Computors) validate transactions using probabilistic quantum states. 
- **Status:** Research & Development.
- **Goal:** Reach 15.5M+ TPS with zero-cloning quantum security.

## 🛠 Project Structure
- `/core`: The fundamental consensus engine based on Quorum logic.
- `/src/quantum_logic`: Implementation of quantum simulation and superposition variables.
- `/docs`: Technical whitepaper and roadmap towards Q-Day readiness.

## 🤝 Acknowledgements
This project is inspired by the early work of **Andi Muhammad Harpianto** on mobile-optimized Qubic implementations and the original vision of **Sergey Ivancheglo**.
