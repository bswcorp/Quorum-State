# Quorum-State ($QSTATE)
> **The First Quantum-Superposition Quorum Blockchain.**

This project is a high-evolution fork from the original Qubicoin implementation, 
re-engineered to bridge Quorum-Based Computation with Quantum Superposition.

## Core Vision
Quorum-State aims to solve the Q-Day threat by integrating:
- **UPoW (Useful Proof of Work):** Training AI in quantum-simulated environments.
- **Superposition Consensus:** Leveraging 676 nodes to validate probabilistic quantum states.
- **Post-Quantum Security:** Lattice-based cryptography integration.

## Development Status
Current implementation is migrating from standard binary Quorum logic (Qubicoin) 
to Quantum-State Simulation.
